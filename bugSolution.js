After thorough investigation, I discovered that the crash was caused by an asynchronous operation that was not properly handled within a specific component. The component attempted to update its state after it had been unmounted, leading to a silent crash on Android. The solution involved checking if the component was still mounted before updating its state.  Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const mounted = useRef(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      mounted.current = false;
    };
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await someAsyncOperation();
        if (mounted.current) {
          setData(response);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  // ... rest of the component
};
```
By adding the `mounted` ref and checking `mounted.current` before setting the state, we prevent state updates after unmounting and resolve the silent crash.  This ensures that the application remains stable on all platforms.
